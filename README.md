# Health Hub - Pet Project
## The main idea of the project is a communication system between patients and family doctors.
The project was done mainly to learn new technologies for me and try to use them. The project is not finished and I am unlikely to continue working on it, but I have already gained an incredible amount of new knowledge thanks to working on it.
## Technologies used:
Java and Spring for the backend, Angular and TypeScript for the frontend.
